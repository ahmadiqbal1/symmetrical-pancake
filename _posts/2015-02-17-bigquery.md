re:dash is an open source web application for data collaboration. The re:dash and BigQuery integration enables you to easily share queries with results, visualize them and create dashboards.

## Setup

Setup is easy by using a ready made GCE image with re:dash and BigQuery preconfigured, see the [setup page]({% post_url 2015-02-18-setup %}) for more details.

### Features

1. **Query Editor**: think of [JS Fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) for SQL queries. It's your way to share data in the organization in an open way, by sharing both the dataset and the query that generated it. This way everyone can peer review not only the resulting dataset but also the process that generated it.
2. **Visualizations**: once you have a dataset, you can create different visualizations out of it. Currently it supports charts, pivot table and cohorts.
3. **Dashboards**: combine several visualizations into a single dashboard.
